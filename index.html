			Arrowmsith Genetic Inc. was founded in December 2021 to mobilize inventions based on 20+ years of genetic research and insights in the labs of Phil Hieter and Peter Stirling. In Sep’23 the company developed the capabilities, both in-house talent and through contracted key partners, to drive programs from idea through to Development Candidate stage. In Apr’24 Arrowsmith secured the exclusive worldwide rights to these platform technologies and improvements from UBC and BC Cancer.
